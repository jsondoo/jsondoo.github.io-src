            <h1>Being a Teaching Assistant</h1>
            <h4>June 5th, 2017</h4>
            <hr/>
            <p>So after being a teaching assistant for 8 months, I thought I would write about my experience.</p>
            <p>From Sept-Dec 2016, I was a teaching assistant for <a
                    href="https://courses.students.ubc.ca/cs/main?pname=subjarea&tname=subjareas&req=3&dept=APSC&course=160" target="_blank">APSC
                160</a>,
                an introductory programming course for engineering students in C. You mainly learn about the basics such
                as if/else, loops, and functions, and an additional hardware component at the end.</p>
            <p>There was about four lecture sections, taught by Celina Berg, Ed Knorr, and Jonatan Schroeder. We had
                weekly meetings, where instructors would give us an
                update on what the upcoming week's lab is about, collect lab attendance sheets, and have a general
                discussion about
                how everything is going. </p>
            <p>Lab sections were kind of like exams. Students were not allowed to talk to their friends, use their
                phones, or access the internet for help. My role as a TA was to
                pass out the lab worksheet, answer any general questions, and make sure that nobody was cheating. I am
                not sure
                why it is so strict but it's been this way for years. We were also not allowed to help them with the lab
                until it was over, so the other TA and I usually held
                short office hour sessions to explain concepts to struggling students.</p>
            <p>Marking labs was a LOT of work. Usually it would take me two hours to mark a section of 20-30 students.
                First,
                you download a folder from the Connect Gradebook which contains source code files for each student in
                the section. Then,
                you compile the code, run it, test it with different inputs, make sure they had sufficient comments, and
                use a rubric on Connect to assign them a mark. </p>
            <p>Sounds straight forward but <a href="https://i.redd.it/671bo01674ey.jpg" target="_blank">half of the time the code did not
                even compile.</a> And if it
                did there were infinite loops or buggy outputs. This was a pain, because then you have to carefully
                examine their code,
                decide on how to give part marks, and take extra time to leave feedback. So depending on the quality of
                the code,
                marking a single student could take anywhere from 2 minutes to 15 minutes. Not to mention, dealing with
                emails and updating marks when students switch lab sections drained even more time. I did improve my efficiency
                and debugging skills over time though.</p>
            <p>Marking midterms and finals was a bit better. You get assigned a question to mark, and you just go
                through a pile of exams,
                give a mark, and pass it on. For coding questions, there's always many ways to implement it, so you
                really
                had to carefully step through the code, and reach a consensus on giving part marks. It's fun because you
                get
                to see all kinds of solutions - unreadable solutions, clever solutions, or solutions that make you
                wonder
                what the hell they were thinking.</p>
            <p>Oh, and free food. For finals marking, we started off our morning with bagels, yogurt,
                bananas, and coffee. Later, we ordered some indian food - trays of rice, curry, and chicken wings,
                and bottles of pop. It was pretty much a full course meal.</p>
            <p>Overall, being a teaching assistant was an amazing experience. It was a great opportunity for me to
                interact
                with professors, and really get to know them - they are all wonderful people that I still keep in touch
                with.
                It was lot of fun talking to students, and engaging with them throughout the course. Engineering is
                tough, and it's rewarding to
                help struggling students, give them advice on how to succeed not only in the course, but in academics
                in general, and watch them improve their programming skills. I would definitely do it again :)</p>
            <p>This is getting long so I will talk about being a CPSC 210 TA some other time.</p>
